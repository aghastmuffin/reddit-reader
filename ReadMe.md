# RedditReader Installation
simply download your choice of the contents of either the seperated folder (recommended) or the onefile folder (depricated) or run `gh repo clone aghastmuffin/reddit-reader` and locate the folder you wish to use. Please also ensure that you have both [FFMPEG](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/) use gyan.dev and install the normal ffmpeg, not minimal. Whilst it is not tested with [BtbN](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds) it should work. The program also requires the use of [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php) download or check if it is installed through `magick` (note: sometimes ffmpeg and magick won't work in cmd, and only in powershell. If it still isn't working, ensure both ffmpeg and imagemagick are on PATH, and restart all terminals). This program is only tested on windows and it is recommended to have an external graphics card (but not needed). 16+ GB memory (the more the merrier) and enough storage to hold this and a couple of files (shouldn't be more than 1 gb at the very most). A multicore CPU, and that's about it! Most processing is done on-system so you might want some more beefy components or to outsource to google colab or repl.it
